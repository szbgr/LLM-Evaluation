        "output": "De Morgan's laws are fundamental laws in boolean algebra and propositional logic, stating the equivalence between certain logical expressions. They are named after the British mathematician Augustus De Morgan.\nAccording to De Morgan's laws:\n\n- The negation of a conjunction is the disjunction of the negations. It can be mathematically stated as follows: \u00ac(a \u2227 b) \u21d4 \u00aca \u2228 \u00acb. It means if \"a AND b\" is not true, then \"NOT a OR NOT b\" is true and vice versa.\n  \n- The negation of a disjunction is the conjunction of the negations. Mathematically written as: \u00ac(a \u2228 b) \u21d4 \u00aca \u2227 \u00acb. It means if \"a OR b\" is not true (they're not both true), then \"NOT a AND NOT b\" is true and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, options (a) and (b) correctly state De Morgan's laws, while options (c) is repeating the same rule as option (a) and option (d) doesn't represent any of De Morgan's laws.",
